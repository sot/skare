To Do:

- Break template into installable packages as much as possible
- IDL startup and batch startup into template (or as a package)
- $SKA/include/Task_template etc
- Write HowTo for binary exec installation
- Find a way to run skare on rhodes:
   - Force perl to be /usr/local/bin/perl on rhodes --or--
   - Make flt_envs run on 5.005 ??



Transition plan
---------------
X Install skare for Solaris 8, 10 and FC8 (i686 and x86_64) in /proj/sot/ska/dev
  - Skip python installation on Solaris
  - Include DBD::Sybase
X Install starcheck and test on Solaris 10 and x86_64
  - Solaris 10 - test on zip and kracko
X Check devel procedure for arc on x86_64. 

- Shut down cron jobs
  - arc
  - dsn_summary

- Do everything as user aca

- From /proj/sot/ska
  mkdir classic
  mv bin lib include classic/

- From ~/Scratch/skare
  setenv SKA /proj/sot/ska
  ./configure --prefix=/proj/sot/ska
  make base_dirs perl perl_dbi   # Solaris 8 and Solaris 10
  make all                       # i686 and x86_64

- Install and test starcheck Dec-2008-B release
  cd /pool14/aldcroft/Release...
  ./configure --prefix=/proj/sot/ska
  make install
  env SKA=/proj/sot/ska PERL5LIB='' SYBASE='' SYBASE_OCS='' \
    /proj/sot/ska/bin/starcheck.pl -dir AUG0104A -fid_char fid_CHARACTERIS_JUL01 -out test
  
- Install latest arc
- Restart arc and dsn_summary
  
- 

Fallback
--------
  cd /proj/sot/ska
  mkdir skare
  mv bin lib include arch skare/
  mv classic/* ./

  cd /pool14/aldcroft/Release..
  env SKA=/proj/sot/ska PERL5LIB='' SYBASE='' SYBASE_OCS='' \
    /proj/sot/ska/bin/starcheck.pl -dir AUG0104A -fid_char fid_CHARACTERIS_JUL01 -out test
